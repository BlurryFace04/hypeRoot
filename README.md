# hypeRoot
hypeRoot is a cross-chain platform that bridges Rootstock, a Bitcoin sidechain
compatible with Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most widely adopted
private blockchain frameworks. With hypeRoot, enterprises can lock RBTC tokens in a
smart contract on the Rootstock network and, in return, they are issued equivalent
Fabric tokens on their internal Hyperledger Fabric network. These Fabric tokens can
then be unlocked for RBTC or transferred within the Fabric network as needed.
hypeRoot empowers enterprises to customize chaincode functions within their Fabric
network, enhancing their operations by integrating the benefits of both public and
private blockchains.

## Rootstock (RSK)
Rootstock (RSK) is a two-way pegged sidechain to Bitcoin designed to enable full Turing-complete smart contract functionality for the Bitcoin network. It uses RBTC as its native cryptocurrency, which is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin. Rootstock is compatible with Ethereum, meaning that it can run the same smart contracts and DApps.

## Hyperledger Fabric
Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source blockchain framework hosted by the Linux Foundation. It's one of the most widely adopted private blockchain frameworks due to its modular architecture, enabling plug-and-play components around membership services and consensus mechanisms. Hyperledger Fabric is mainly used by enterprises looking to deploy production-ready business blockchain applications.
